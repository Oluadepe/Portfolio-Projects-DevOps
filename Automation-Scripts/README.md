# AUTOMATION SCRIPTS
This set of scripts has been developed to streamline the automation of environment setup. For each script, we've outlined specific use cases, and when necessary, we've consolidated multiple scripts into a single one for automation. To fully grasp the utility of each script and the prerequisites for their usage, please take the time to understand their functions.

## REGAINING ACCESS TO A REMOTE SERVER WITH A LOST KEY
<p>If you happen to misplace the key for your server, access can only be regained from the machine where you've previously copied the public key to the server. Access from other machines will not be possible as it will require the .pem key specific to that machine.

The <strong>GOOD NEWS</strong> is that the "Gain_access_remote_server_with_lost_key.sh" script enables you to regain access to your server using a new .pem key from the rescue remote server. There are certain prerequisites you need to meet to make this possible.
